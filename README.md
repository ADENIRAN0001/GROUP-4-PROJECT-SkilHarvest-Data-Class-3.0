### PROJECT OVERVIEW 
Our team is made up of five (5) seasoned Data Analyst who are motivated to use the knowledge acquired in the course of the training to analyse data and generate insights that will surely move the organization to the desired level through Data-Driven decisions. We worked on a finance data which was titled USA APPROVED LOAN DATA. 

### Selection of Dataset 
The data was obtained from Kaggle after a cross examination of different datasets suggested by each member of the team. We eventually picked the USA APPROVED LOAN DATA because it require us to use all the Data Analysis toolkits we have een taught and we will be able to generate Data-driven suggestions for existing loan companies, those who are planning to venture into the business and for potential borrowers (loan takers).  

### Understanding the dataset
Due ot the peculiarity of the selected Dataset, it was important for us of have the correct understanding of what the data is all about. This will hlp us to properly explore the data and not give a wrong interpretation and visualization of the data. We had to study financial and accounting termilogies to aid our exploration of the dataset. We also took out a good amount of time to study the Dataset dictionary and each of the columns in Dataset.
